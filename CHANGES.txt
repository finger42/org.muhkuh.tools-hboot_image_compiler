v0.0.2

  * Add a "overwrite_address" attribute for data chunks from ELF sections.
    It allows to overwrite the load address of the data.

  * Add a "segments" attribute to use only the selected segments from an ELF
    file.

  * Fix the command line interpreter to accept the "NETX90_MPW_APP" for
    "--netx-type".

  * Change the extraction method of the start address from an ELF file.
    The old way extracted all symbols with the "readelf" tool and searched for
    a global symbol with the name "start".
    The new way reads the file header - again with the "readelf" tool - and
    extracts the line with the "Entry point address".
