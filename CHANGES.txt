v0.0.4

  * Add a new option "-S" / "--sniplib" to specify a sniplib location.
    The option can be used multiple times to specify more than one sniplib.

  * Accept hexadecimal values for the "offset" attribute.

  * Fix the "Skip" and "XIP" chunks for non zero offsets.

  * Read the RootCert, LicenseCert, CA9Software and CR7Software chunks from a
    file, if a "File" child node is present.


v0.0.3

  * Support the SQIROM0 and SQIROM1 areas on the netX4000.

  * Add "fill" and "file" attributes to the "Skip" tag.

  * Create "Text" chunks.

  * Add the attributes "has_header" and "has_end" to control the output of the header and end marker.


v0.0.2

  * Add a "overwrite_address" attribute for data chunks from ELF sections.
    It allows to overwrite the load address of the data.

  * Add a "segments" attribute to use only the selected segments from an ELF
    file.

  * Fix the command line interpreter to accept the "NETX90_MPW_APP" for
    "--netx-type".

  * Change the extraction method of the start address from an ELF file.
    The old way extracted all symbols with the "readelf" tool and searched for
    a global symbol with the name "start".
    The new way reads the file header - again with the "readelf" tool - and
    extracts the line with the "Entry point address".
